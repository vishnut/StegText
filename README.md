# StegText

Note: This project is for entertainment and for the *lolz*. I am not a security expert and while basic steganography with AES encryption and passwords might be great for personal use, I cannot make any guarantees about how safe this truly is.

I have made some significant changes to make it much more secure than it was. I now use AES encryption and a random secret key on the hidden string. I also leave the option of using the default key if security is not important to you. 

If you do find vulnerabilities or have any improvements, I would love to hear from you. Submit a PR, open an issue, or just message me and we can collaborate.
